The bull case treats SIG as a platform business deserving a premium multiple. The bear case points to a <span class=\"key-stat down\">~58.6x trailing P/E</span> for what is fundamentally a low-margin retail distribution business, with <strong>5.6 billion escrow shares</strong> about to flood the market.",

    },
    "evidenceCheck": "The operational evidence is genuinely strong: CW's retail network is Australia's most successful pharmacy chain, the vertical integration with Sigma's wholesale business is strategically sound, and the synergy upgrade from A$60M to A$100M suggests management confidence. However, the <strong>valuation evidence is uniformly bearish</strong>: Morningstar's 219% premium estimate, the ~58.6x trailing P/E for a retail business, and the imminent escrow release all point to significant downside risk. The question is not whether the business is good (it is), but whether the price already reflects a best-case scenario.",
    "narrativeStability": "<strong>Unstable, skewed negative.</strong> The narrative is dominated by the approaching escrow release (~August 2026). Every month closer to that date increases the overhang pressure. The first post-merger integration update and any insider selling patterns will set the tone. If CW insiders begin orderly sell-downs before escrow release, the stock could de-rate ahead of the event."

N1 (Integration) is scored cautiously because insufficient time has elapsed to assess execution.
