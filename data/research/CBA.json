The bull case is straightforward: CBA's digital leadership (8.7M app users), cost efficiency (44.7% CTI), and dominant market position create a compounding machine that deserves a structural premium. The bear case is equally clear: at 24x forward earnings, the stock is priced for a level of perfection that banking economics cannot deliver. NIMs are compressing (1.99%, down 14bp from peak), mortgage competition is intensifying, and credit costs are at cyclical lows that must eventually normalise. The question is not whether CBA is a great franchise: it is: but whether the current price already reflects that quality and then some.",

Base case (20x, NIM compresses to 1.90%): ~$140. Bear case (16x, credit costs normalise): ~$110. The risk/reward is asymmetric to the downside. Even the bull case offers only ~3% upside, while the bear case implies 35% downside."
    },
    "evidenceCheck": "Evidence across 10 domains confirms franchise quality is intact but highlights valuation risk. Corporate communications emphasise digital leadership and cost discipline. Statutory filings show NIM declining from peak. Broker consensus is divided (7 Buy, 8 Hold, 5 Sell). Alternative data confirms app dominance but deposit mix is shifting unfavourably. Academic research on bank valuations suggests premium multiples eventually mean-revert. Governance is strong under Matt Comyn. Registry data shows passive inflows supporting price but active managers underweight.",
    "narrativeStability": "Moderate: The quality narrative is stable, but the valuation narrative is stretched. Any NIM miss, credit cost surprise, or competitive share loss could trigger a de-rating. The narrative is vulnerable to the very thing that created it: perfection is priced in, so any imperfection is punished."
