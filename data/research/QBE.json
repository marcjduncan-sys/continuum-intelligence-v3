    "overview": "QBE Insurance Group is one of the world's 20 largest general insurers and reinsurers, operating across three divisions: North America, International (Europe, Emerging Markets), and Pacific (Australia, New Zealand). The business writes commercial, specialty, and crop insurance with a deliberate focus on profitable underwriting discipline. FY25 was a landmark year: the 91.9% COR represents the strongest underwriting performance since the pre-2011 catastrophe period, and the 4.9% investment portfolio return reflects the structural benefit of US rates remaining at elevated levels. QBE's strategic priority is sustaining COR below 94% through the underwriting cycle while growing GWP by 5-7% annually."

The <strong>structural bear case remains the insurance cycle</strong> — premium markets soften, capital re-enters, and margins compress. The academic literature on insurance cycles is clear that hard markets do not persist indefinitely. However, QBE's current underwriting quality and balance sheet strength suggest the cycle has further to run. The key discriminating variable for 2026 is catastrophe season performance.",
    "narrativeStability": "<strong>Conditionally stable, skewed upside.</strong> The FY25 beat has materially improved market confidence in QBE's underwriting discipline. The narrative is stable as long as: (1) no above-budget catastrophe season in 2026; (2) commercial insurance pricing holds; (3) investment income continues to benefit from elevated rates.
