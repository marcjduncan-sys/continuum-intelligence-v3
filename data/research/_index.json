Two operating divisions: Fortescue Metals (iron ore, 56% EBITDA margin) and Fortescue Energy (green hydrogen, green iron, copper). Energy division has scaled back significantly: cancelled Arizona hydrogen and PEM50 projects with US$150M+ in writedowns. Green hydrogen cost of US$4.50-6.00/kg remains uncompetitive versus grey hydrogen at US$1.00-2.00/kg. Continuing energy initiatives include green iron metal technology, TES partnership, and copper exploration (Alta deal in Peru).

Jansen potash (Saskatchewan, Canada) represents BHP's largest greenfield investment at ~US$5.7B, with first production expected late CY2026. Nickel West was placed on care and maintenance in 2024. The failed ~GBP39B approach for Anglo American (mid-2024) highlighted BHP's appetite for further copper consolidation."
