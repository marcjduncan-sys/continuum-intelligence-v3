Stock down 60% in 8 months as AI disruption fears rip through the SaaS sector &mdash; Anthropic's Claude AI was specifically cited as a catalyst for the February 2026 tech rout that saw the ASX IT Index fall 9.4% in one session. Despite the sell-off, the business is executing: revenue +20%, ARPU +15%, Rule of 40 at 44.5%, churn at historic lows. Melio B2B payments acquisition (US$2.5B) approaching breakeven 6-12 months ahead of plan. Xero argues its moat lies in domain expertise, decades of accounting data, regulatory compliance, payment rails, and a 1,000+ app ecosystem that AI cannot replicate overnight."

The defining near-term risk is the <strong>5.6 billion escrow shares</strong> releasing around August 2026, which could create massive selling pressure. Morningstar estimates a 219% premium to fair value. Synergy targets have been upgraded from A$60M to A$100M, but integration costs of A$95-105M over 3-4 years offset near-term benefits.",

FY25 record shipments of 198.4 Mt at an industry-leading C1 cost of US$18.17/wmt (hematite). Two operating divisions: Fortescue Metals (iron ore, 56% EBITDA margin) and Fortescue Energy (green hydrogen, green iron, copper). Energy division has scaled back significantly: cancelled Arizona hydrogen and PEM50 projects with US$150M+ in writedowns. Green hydrogen cost of US$4.50-6.00/kg remains uncompetitive versus grey hydrogen at US$1.00-2.00/kg. Continuing energy initiatives include green iron metal technology, TES partnership, and copper exploration (Alta deal in Peru). Founded by Andrew Forrest, who remains Executive Chairman with ~36% shareholding."

NAB also operates Personal Banking, Corporate &amp; Institutional Banking, and Bank of New Zealand (BNZ). Cost-to-income ratio of ~44% is best-in-class among the Big Four. New CEO Andrew Irvine (September 2024, ex-CIB head) inherits a well-run franchise but at stretched valuations."

The strategic pivot toward copper is underway &mdash; the A$9.6B OZ Minerals acquisition (2023) added Prominent Hill and Carrapateena to Escondida and Olympic Dam, building one of the world's largest copper resource bases. Jansen potash (Saskatchewan, Canada) represents BHP's largest greenfield investment at ~US$5.7B, with first production expected late CY2026. Nickel West was placed on care and maintenance in 2024. The failed ~GBP39B approach for Anglo American (mid-2024) highlighted BHP's appetite for further copper consolidation."

FY24 revenue $10.2B (+8%), underlying EBITA $720M (7.1% margin), backlog $16.8B (record). Net debt $2.1B declining from peak of $3.2B post-acquisition. Stock has de-rated from $17.50 to $12.85 on margin concerns and project delays."

The investment portfolio delivered a 4.9% return on US$28.9B in assets, contributing US$1,633M. The stock rallied 8.6% on the day. At 12.0x trailing P/E with a 4.3% yield, QBE screens as reasonably valued if the hard market and investment income tailwinds persist.

The business writes commercial, specialty, and crop insurance with a deliberate focus on profitable underwriting discipline. FY25 was a landmark year: the 91.9% COR represents the strongest underwriting performance since the pre-2011 catastrophe period, and the 4.9% investment portfolio return reflects the structural benefit of US rates remaining at elevated levels. QBE's strategic priority is sustaining COR below 94% through the underwriting cycle while growing GWP by 5-7% annually."

FY26 guidance calls for a <strong>slight EBIT increase</strong> versus FY25's A$204.6M EBIT â€” implying the company can absorb some margin pressure through pricing and volume.

      "overview": "Breville Group is Australia's most successful global consumer brand export â€” a premium kitchen appliance company with genuine pricing power in a competitive global market. The Breville brand commands premium positioning in espresso machines, juicers, food processors, and smart cooking appliances across North America, APAC, and increasingly online. The Sage brand (acquired via acquisition of Sage Appliances in 2020) performs the same role in Europe and the UK, where premium espresso culture is deeply embedded. The company is pursuing a strategy of product innovation (connected appliances, barista-grade home espresso), geographic expansion (Continental European Sage penetration), and new product categories (cooking, food preparation). FY26 margin pressure is the immediate challenge: US tariffs on Asian-manufactured goods (Breville manufactures primarily in China and Vietnam) have compressed gross margins, and the company is working to offset this through pricing, mix shift, and supply chain diversification."
