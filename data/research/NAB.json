The stock is trading above broker consensus targets, which is unusual and typically unsustainable. The evidence is <strong>moderately supportive of franchise quality but moderately negative on valuation</strong>.",
    "narrativeStability": "<strong>Moderately fragile.</strong> The premium valuation narrative is new &mdash; NAB has only traded at 20x P/E in the current cycle, not historically. The narrative rests on macro conditions (soft landing, benign credit) that are exogenous to NAB's control. The 1H FY2026 results (~May 2026) will be the first major read under new CEO Andrew Irvine. A NIM miss of >5bp or credit charge uplift of >A$200M could trigger de-rating. Conversely, if the RBA cutting cycle proves shallower than expected, NIM resilience would support the premium."
