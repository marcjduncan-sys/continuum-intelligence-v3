The <span class=\"key-stat\">$400M</span> above-store cost-out program, e-commerce scaling at <span class=\"key-stat up\">+17%</span> growth rates, and simplified operations will restore Australian Food to mid-to-high single-digit EBIT growth. The premium valuation (<span class=\"key-stat\">23.9x</span> forward P/E) assumes this recovery is underway.",

    "evidenceCheck": "The turnaround narrative has supporting evidence (Q1 FY26 trading data, cost-out program on track, NPS improvement) but also faces material risks that are <strong>structural, not cyclical</strong>: mandatory regulatory code now in force, ACCC court proceedings pending, Aldi expanding, consumer price sensitivity elevated, and management itself has called FY26 \"transitional\" with recovery \"below ambition.\" The evidence is genuinely contested.",
    "narrativeStability": "<strong>Fragile.</strong> The turnaround narrative is new. Bardwell has been CEO for approximately 18 months. FY25 was the first full year under her leadership, and it delivered a 19% NPAT decline. The narrative rests almost entirely on forward promises ($400M cost-out, FY26 as transitional) rather than demonstrated results. The 1H FY26 results on 25 February will be the first real test."
