The sustainability revenue mix reached 49% (vs 36% in FY22), confirming the structural shift. However, EBITA margin of 7.1% remains below the 8-9% target, dragged by legacy fixed-price contracts and integration costs. Net debt of $2.1B (2.9x EBITDA) is elevated but declining. The stock has sold off 35% on concerns about margin trajectory and project delays in hydrogen/CCS segments. At current levels, the market is pricing in execution failure rather than the structural growth opportunity the backlog implies.",
