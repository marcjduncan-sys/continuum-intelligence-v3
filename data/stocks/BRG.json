      "description": "Revenue growth sustains 8-10%+ pa; pricing and supply chain diversification restore gross margins to 37%+; operating leverage drives EBIT expansion",
      "plain_english": "This is the bull case — Breville's premium brand keeps growing despite tariff headwinds, and margins recover as pricing actions and supply chain diversification take hold.",
