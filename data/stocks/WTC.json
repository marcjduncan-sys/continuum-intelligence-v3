      "plain_english": "The worst of the governance crisis is behind WiseTech. The new CEO is stabilising the company, the CargoWise platform remains dominant in its niche, and once investor confidence returns, the stock could recover toward its pre-crisis valuation.",
      "what_to_watch": "New CEO's first strategy update and H1 FY26 customer churn metrics. If churn returns to pre-crisis levels (<5%) and new contract wins resume, recovery becomes credible.",

      "what_to_watch": "FY26 ARR growth rate and valuation multiple vs ASX tech peers. If the governance discount narrows and growth holds at 15%+, this narrative holds.",
