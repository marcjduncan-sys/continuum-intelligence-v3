      "description": "Governance concerns priced in; product moat intact; returns to premium growth trajectory",
      "plain_english": "The worst of the governance crisis is behind WiseTech. The new CEO is stabilising the company, the CargoWise platform remains dominant in its niche, and once investor confidence returns, the stock could recover toward its pre-crisis valuation.",
      "what_to_watch": "New CEO's first strategy update and H1 FY26 customer churn metrics. If churn returns to pre-crisis levels (<5%) and new contract wins resume, recovery becomes credible.",

      "plain_english": "WiseTech is still a good software business with strong recurring revenue, but investors are no longer willing to pay a premium valuation because of lingering governance concerns. The stock trades at fair value for a mid-growth software company.",
      "what_to_watch": "FY26 ARR growth rate and valuation multiple vs ASX tech peers. If the governance discount narrows and growth holds at 15%+, this narrative holds.",
      "upside": "Stable execution could gradually close the governance discount over 12-18 months.",
