The platform expansion strategy is working by every measurable metric. But the market is pricing none of it. The stock is down 60% from A$194 despite delivering four consecutive earnings beats. All 15 covering analysts rate Buy with an average target of A$191 (143% upside from A$78.50). The dislocation between price and fundamentals has never been wider in Xero's history.",

B2B payments are becoming the wedge product for US SMB market penetration. The payments+accounting bundle creates a competitive proposition that QuickBooks cannot match on payments and PayPal cannot match on accounting. At current depressed valuations, the market is assigning near-zero value to Melio &mdash; any evidence of integration success represents pure upside optionality.",

The February 2026 sell-off was specifically triggered by Anthropic's Claude AI demonstrations, which the market interpreted as capable of automating core accounting workflows. The ASX IT Index fell 9.4% in a single session. Xero fell from ~A$95 to A$78.50, breaking through every prior support level. The 60% drawdown from A$194 is no longer a generic SaaS re-rating &mdash; it is the market pricing a specific, named AI threat to cloud accounting business models. The absence of churn is noted but considered a lagging indicator by the market. Price leads fundamentals; this is the market front-running a structural shift.",

This thesis has weakened further: no competitor is demonstrably taking share, Intuit's growth is in tax and mid-market (not SMB cloud), and MYOB remains stagnant under private ownership.

The stock is down 60% from its highs &mdash; an acceleration from the 55% decline just weeks ago &mdash; after an ASX tech sector rout triggered by Anthropic's Claude AI demonstrations that the market interpreted as threatening to cloud accounting moats. But here are the facts: revenue grew 20%, ARPU grew 15%, churn is at historic lows, Rule of 40 is 44.5%, and all 15 covering analysts rate Buy with an average target of A$191 (143% upside). The Melio B2B payments acquisition is approaching breakeven 6-12 months ahead of schedule. The gap between what the business is doing and what the market is pricing has never been wider. This is either the opportunity of the cycle or the market correctly front-running a paradigm shift that hasn't yet appeared in any metric.",
