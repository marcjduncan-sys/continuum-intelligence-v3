      "label": "Copper Supercycle",
      "description": "BHP Group executes on growth strategy; earnings accelerate",
      "plain_english": "Structural copper supply deficit emerges as electrification (EVs require 3-4x more copper than ICE vehicles), AI data centre build-out, grid infrastructure upgrades, and renewable energy installations drive demand growth of 3-5% annually. BHP's expanded copper portfolio (Escondida, Olympic Dam, OZ Minerals assets) positions it as one of the top 3 global copper producers. Copper grows from ~25% to 35-40% of group EBITDA by FY2028.",

      "description": "BHP Group delivers steady-state results; valuation holds",
      "plain_english": "Iron ore remains the dominant earnings driver. Pilbara operations produce ~280-290 Mtpa at industry-leading C1 costs of US$15-17/t. Iron ore prices remain supported at US$100-120/t by infrastructure spending, manufacturing demand, and emerging market urbanisation (India). Dividend policy (min 50% payout) plus buybacks generate total returns of 7-9% annually.",

      "plain_english": "China's property sector remains in a prolonged downturn (Evergrande, Country Garden defaults). New housing starts have fallen significantly from peak. If China's steel production declines materially, iron ore prices could fall to US$80-90/t, compressing BHP's largest earnings segment by 30-40%. Infrastructure spending provides a partial offset but cannot fully compensate.",

      "description": "A structural shift changes the investment case for BHP Group",
      "plain_english": "We are near the top of a commodity supercycle. A global recession or demand shock causes simultaneous declines in iron ore, copper, and met coal prices. BHP's earnings are highly leveraged to commodity prices it does not control. A 2008-style downturn could see a 40-50% earnings decline. The Nickel West impairment (US$2.5B write-down) is a reminder that commodity thesis conviction can prove wrong.",

At <span class=\"key-stat\">A$52.74</span>, the stock trades near 52-week highs (<span class=\"key-stat\">A$52.40</span>), implying confidence in both commodity price resilience and the strategic pivot toward future-facing minerals. The embedded thesis is that iron ore earnings sustain the dividend floor while copper and potash deliver the growth.",
