China has passed peak steel (2020), iron ore prices are forecast to decline to US$83-95/t by end-2026, Simandou will add 120 Mtpa of new supply, and the Energy division has written off US$150M+ on cancelled green hydrogen projects. Andrew Forrest's ~36% stake concentrates governance risk. The stock trades <strong>above consensus broker targets</strong> of A$18.58-19.86, making it one of the few ASX 50 stocks where the market is more bullish than analysts.",
