      "plain_english": "CSL's plasma collection business is recovering from COVID disruption, and its recent acquisition of Vifor Pharma is starting to deliver cost savings. If both trends continue, earnings growth could accelerate beyond current expectations.",

      "plain_english": "CSL continues doing what it does best — growing earnings at 7-10% per year, driven by its dominant position in the global plasma market. The company deserves its premium valuation because of its deep competitive moat and long runway of growth.",
      "what_to_watch": "FY26 earnings guidance at H1 result. If guidance stays at 7-10% NPATA growth, the base case holds firm.",

      "plain_english": "Several things could go wrong at once: the Vifor acquisition might cost more to integrate than expected, plasma margins might not recover as fast as management promised, and the strong Australian dollar could eat into overseas earnings when converted back.",
      "what_to_watch": "Vifor integration costs in H1 FY26 and AUD/USD exchange rate trajectory. If integration costs rise or AUD strengthens above 0.70, downside risk increases.",
      "upside": null,
