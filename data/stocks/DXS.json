CBD net absorption is turning positive, vacancy rates are stabilising, and Dexus's premium office portfolio in Sydney and Melbourne is well-positioned to capture the recovery. If cap rates compress and rents grow, NTA per unit will recover and close the gap with the current share price.",
      "what_to_watch": "H1 FY26 results (18 February 2026): office occupancy, like-for-like income growth, and cap rate movements. Positive net absorption across CBDs would confirm the recovery thesis.",

The stock trades at a discount to NTA but reflects the market's fair assessment of the office headwinds.",

Companies continue to reduce their office footprint, sublease space floods the market, and CBD vacancy rates stay elevated. Dexus's office-heavy portfolio suffers ongoing valuation writedowns, and the NTA discount to share price persists or widens.",

Dexus, with significant debt facilities, is exposed to refinancing risk at higher rates.",
