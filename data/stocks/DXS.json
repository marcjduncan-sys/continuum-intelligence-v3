      "plain_english": "The worst of the Australian office downturn is over. CBD net absorption is turning positive, vacancy rates are stabilising, and Dexus's premium office portfolio in Sydney and Melbourne is well-positioned to capture the recovery. If cap rates compress and rents grow, NTA per unit will recover and close the gap with the current share price.",
      "what_to_watch": "H1 FY26 results (18 February 2026): office occupancy, like-for-like income growth, and cap rate movements. Positive net absorption across CBDs would confirm the recovery thesis.",
      "upside": "If office cap rates compress 25-50bps and rents grow 3-5%, Dexus NTA could recover meaningfully, driving a share price re-rating.",

      "plain_english": "Dexus continues its strategic pivot from pure office toward a diversified real assets platform. Industrial development delivers strong returns, funds management fees grow steadily, and distributions remain well-covered. The stock trades at a discount to NTA but reflects the market's fair assessment of the office headwinds.",

      "plain_english": "The shift to hybrid work is permanent and accelerating. Companies continue to reduce their office footprint, sublease space floods the market, and CBD vacancy rates stay elevated. Dexus's office-heavy portfolio suffers ongoing valuation writedowns, and the NTA discount to share price persists or widens.",
      "what_to_watch": "CBD vacancy rates (PCA data), tenant lease expiry profiles, and any major tenant downsizing announcements. Rising sublease availability is the clearest negative signal.",

      "plain_english": "If interest rates stay higher for longer than the market expects, REIT valuations face a double hit: higher discount rates compress asset values, and higher debt costs eat into distributable earnings. Dexus, with significant debt facilities, is exposed to refinancing risk at higher rates.",
      "what_to_watch": "RBA cash rate trajectory and bond yields. If the 10-year government bond yield rises above 5%, REIT valuations face further pressure.",
