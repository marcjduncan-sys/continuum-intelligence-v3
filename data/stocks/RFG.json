      "plain_english": "The bull case requires franchise network stabilisation and eventually growth.

Gloria Jean's faces structural headwinds from third-wave specialty coffee. If multiple brands fail to sustain viable franchisee economics, the portfolio could shrink below critical mass.",

The franchise crisis of 2017-2020 destroyed enormous value (share price collapsed from ~A$8 to near zero pre-consolidation). Under CEO Peter George, the company has stabilised operations, reduced debt, and returned to underlying profitability. But the <strong>persistent downtrend and micro-cap status</strong> signal the market remains deeply sceptical about sustainable growth.",
