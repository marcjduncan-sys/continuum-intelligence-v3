      "plain_english": "The bull case relies on OCL's SaaS transition accelerating, with cloud ARR growth in the 20-30% range driving a re-rating as the revenue mix shifts toward recurring subscriptions. Higher lifetime customer value and improved margins at SaaS maturity would justify premium multiples.",

      "plain_english": "Governments across ANZ and UK are mandated to digitise citizen-facing services, creating structural demand for OCL's compliance and content management tools. Increasing regulatory complexity, FOI volumes, and planning reforms drive upgrade cycles. This thesis is less about rapid growth and more about resilient, predictable demand.",

If SaaS transition is stalling, total revenue growth disappointing, or customer churn increasing, the premium valuation multiple compresses further. At ~10-12x EV/Revenue, OCL is still priced for growth that may not materialise.",
