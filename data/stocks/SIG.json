But the market has priced this at <strong>~58.6x trailing earnings</strong> for what is fundamentally a low-margin retail and distribution business. The defining near-term risk is the <strong>5.6 billion escrow shares</strong> releasing around August 2026, which could create massive selling pressure. Morningstar estimates a 219% premium to fair value. Synergy targets have been upgraded from A$60M to A$100M, but integration costs of A$95-105M over 3-4 years offset near-term benefits.",
