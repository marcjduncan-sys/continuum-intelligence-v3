The 5.0 GW power bank across 13 cities is a moat that cannot be replicated quickly. A$12.9B in development WIP (57% data centres, rising to 75% by FY26) is 94% pre-committed to hyperscalers. CPP Investments' A$14B European DC partnership validates the platform at institutional scale. Operating EPS grew 9.8% to 118.0 cents with FY26 guidance for further 9% growth. At 36.2x trailing P/E (23.7x forward), the market is paying a premium but the earnings visibility is exceptional.",
