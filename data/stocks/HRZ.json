      "plain_english": "As a pre-production developer, HRZ offers significant operational leverage to the gold price. With AUD gold at historically elevated levels above A$4,000/oz, Boorara economics improve materially. Each A$100/oz move in AUD gold has an outsized impact on project NPV and per-ounce valuation multiples for developers.",

      "plain_english": "The transition from developer to producer at Boorara is the single biggest re-rating catalyst. Kalgoorlie has multiple operating processing plants for toll treatment, reducing upfront capital vs standalone builds.
